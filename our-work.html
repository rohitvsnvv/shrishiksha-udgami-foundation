    <p>
        Shree Shiksha Udgami Foundation would like to acquaint you with the fact that 40% of India‚Äôs population is
         below the age of 18 years, which at 400 million is the world‚Äôs largest child population. This we consider as
          a pleasant one because we look at the huge possibility of uplifting the nation by creating ‚ÄòThe Advantaged Society‚Äô out of this. 
          However, implicitly this reality is neutral since the pleasantness or unpleasantness of it is very much contextual.
    </p><br><br>
    <h2>Ground Realities</h2>
    <p>At Shree Shiksha Udgami Foundation, we believe it is our utmost kartavya to enhance the propensity of this action.
        That is why being an NGO working for education in Ahmedabad we are trying to highlight
         the significance of child education and spreading awareness on how it can affect the growth of an individual as well as the nation.
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Of every 100 children who enroll, 70 drop out by the time they reach the secondary level.</li>
            <li>Of every 100 children who drop out of school, 66 are girls.</li>
        </ul><br>
 <p>
    Moreover, of course, number of enrolments is leapfrogging, but still only less than half of India‚Äôs 
    children between the age group of 6 to 14 go to school.Although number of enrolments, number of schools, and number of 
    teachers has increased remarkably during the past few years; but the quality of learning has either shown no improvement, or
    actually worsened. How? The proportion of all children in Class 5 who can read a Class 2 level text has declined by almost 15% since 2005. 
    Similarly, the portion of student in Class 8 who can do divisions has declined by almost 23% during some period.
    This utterly paints a grim picture of the quality of education available in schools at the moment.
 </p><br>
 <p>
    One prime reason for the lack of improvement in the quality of education is that there is just too much debate and too little action. 
    At Shree Shiksha Udgami Foundation, we believe it is our utmost kartavya to enhance the propensity of this action.
 </p><br>
 <h2>Shree Shiksha Udgami Foundation has two priority areas where we focus our attention and resources.</h2><br>
 <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
    <li>Improving Access to Education</li>
    <li>Improving Quality of Education</li>
    <li>Focusing specially on teaching methodologies</li>
 </ul><br>
 <p>Overall, at Shree Shiksha Udgami Foundation, major components of the ‚ÄòImproving Quality of Education‚Äô are focusing on 
    improving the quality of teaching and learning, using financial, material, and human resources.
</p><br><br>
<p>
